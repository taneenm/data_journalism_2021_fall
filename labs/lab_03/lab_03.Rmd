## Answer questions

Q1: Which five cities located in Kanawha County, West Virginia got the most loans (in number of loans)? How many did each get? To answer this question, you'll have to clean the very messy "city" field.

Note: To answer this question, please fully clean the city field for Kanawha County cities. Hint: once cleaned, the dataframe that counts the number of loans by city should have 38 distinct cities for Kanawha County.

A1: The cities that got the most loans: Charleston with 2837 loans, South Charleston with 484, Saint Albans with 304, Dunbar with 166 loans, Nitro with 142.
```{r}
# Write your code in this codeblock.
wv_ppp_loans %>%
  filter (project_county_name == "KANAWHA") %>%
  clean_names () %>%
  mutate(city = str_to_title(city)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(city = case_when(
    city == "S Charleston" ~ "South Charleston",
    city == "So Charleston" ~ "South Charleston",
    city == "Charelston" ~ "Charleston",
    city == "St. Albans" ~ "Saint Albans",
    city == "St Albans" ~ "Saint Albans",
    city == "St.albans" ~ "Saint Albans",
    city == "Elkveiw" ~ "Elkview",
    city == "Crosslanes" ~ "Cross Lanes",
    city == "Balle" ~ "Belle",
    TRUE ~ city
  )) %>%
  group_by (city) %>%
  summarise (
    count_loans = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange (desc(count_loans))
```

Q2: What is the name of the business that got the largest loan (by dollar value) in the 5-digit ZIP code in West Virginia that had the highest dollar amount in total loans (by dollar value)? Write up a short paragraph that also answers these questions:

* Where in West Virginia is this ZIP code located?
* How much was the business' loan for?
* How much of that loan was forgiven?
* Which number is bigger, the loan amount or the forgiveness amount? Can you explain the discrepancy?

A2: 
The zip code is in Charleston, WV. The business is Jason Kelly PLLC. The business' loan was for 5068472.00. The amount of the loan that was forgiven was 5126618.64. The forgiveness amount is larger than the loan amount. I think the the discrepancy might be because the program made a mistake and forgave too much. There was probably a lack of supervision when granting forgiveness, so the company was forgiven for more than it asked for. 	

```{r}
# Hint
# First, create a dataframe that shows the top 5-digit ZIP code by total dollar amount
wv_ppp_loans %>%
 mutate(zip = str_sub(zip, start=1L, end=5L)) %>%
 group_by(zip) %>%
 summarise (
    total_amount = sum(amount)
  ) %>% 
  arrange (desc(total_amount))
# Second, use the top ZIP code to create a separate dataframe that shows the business with the biggest loan in that ZIP code.
wv_ppp_loans %>%
 mutate(zip = str_sub(zip, start=1L, end=5L)) %>%
   filter(zip == "25301")%>%
   arrange (desc(amount))
  
```


Q3: Five business entities owned by the spouse of a member of West Virginia's U.S. House delegation got PPP loans. Write up a paragraph that answers the following questions.   

  * What are the businesses' names?
  * What do the businesses do?
  * How much money did the five businesses receive in total?
  * What percentage of the total loan amount have been forgiven?
  * How did the U.S. House member vote on the legislation initially author zing the PPP loan program.

Feel free to add any interesting "color" (little interesting details) you find in your research.  

Some hints to help you answer this question:

* West Virginia's three U.S. House members are listed [here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/WV#representatives)
* To find businesses they or their families own, you can search for financial disclosure forms for U.S. House members [here](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/PublicDisclosure/FinancialDisclosure#Search).
  * To speed things up, here are direct links to the three U.S. House members most recent financial disclosures, which I found by searching the site linked above.
  * [Rep. 1](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2020/10042042.pdf)
  * [Rep. 2](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2020/10040330.pdf)
  * [Rep. 3](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2020/10042734.pdf)
* When you examine the disclosure forms, there may be lots of stock sales and retirement accounts mixed in.  Ignore those. In the table in the disclosure forms, look for "Partnership" or "C-Corp" in the column named "Income Type"
* This is a link to details on passage of the [CARES ACT](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748). You can find a link to how the House voted by clicking on a link from [this page](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/actions).

A3:
The businesses' names are Dutch Miller of Charlestone, Inc., Dutch Miller Chevrolet, Inc., Dutch Miller of Charlotte, Inc., Dutch Miller Subaru, Inc., and DM Motor, Inc. The businesses are all car dealerships. In total the five businesses received 3105300. The percentage of the total loan amount that was forgiven was 101.13%. Carol Devine Miller voted yes on the PPP loan program. I saw an article where she was talking about how the democrats were acting too slow and that we really need loan forgiveness fast.  

```{r}
# Hint
# First, create a dataframe that only has loans to those five companies
five_companies<- wv_ppp_loans %>%
  filter (name == "DUTCH MILLER OF CHARLESTON, INC" | name == "DUTCH MILLER CHEVROLET, INC." | name == "DUTCH MILLER OF CHARLOTTE, INC" | name == "DUTCH MILLER SUBARU, INC" | name == "DM MOTOR, INC")

# Second, use that newly created dataframe to calculate total loan amount and percentage forgiven for those companies
five_companies %>%
  select (amount, forgiveness_amount) %>%
 summarise (
    total_amount = sum(amount),
    total_forgiveness_amount = sum(forgiveness_amount),
    percent_forgiven = (total_forgiveness_amount/total_amount)*100
  )
    
```
