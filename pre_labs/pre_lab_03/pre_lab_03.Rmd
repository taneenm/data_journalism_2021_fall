**Answer**
 87,927 problems

```{r}

problems(ppp_maryland_loans)

```

### Task 4: Reload data
**Task** Run the following codeblock to reload the data, using every row to set the data types. Does it show any parsing errors when you run? Answer below
**Answer**
It did not show any parsing errors.
```{r}
ppp_maryland_loans <- read_csv("ppp_loans_md.csv.zip", guess_max=195865)
```

### Task 5: Examine the data with glimpse
**Task** Run the following codeblock to glimpse the data.  What data type is the "amount" field?  What data type is the "name" field? What data type is the id column? Answer below.
**Answer**
The amount field is <dbl>, the name field is <chr>, and the id column is <dbl>.
```{r}
glimpse(ppp_maryland_loans)
```
### Task 6: Change the "id" field data type
**Task** Run the following codeblock to change the data type of the "id" field from a number (dbl) to a character, and then glimpse the data, to see the change.     

```{r}
ppp_maryland_loans <- ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id))

glimpse(ppp_maryland_loans)
```

### Task 7: Examine the franchise column for missing values.
**Task** Run the following codeblock to group by franchise_name, count the numer of loans, then sort from highest to lowest on count. How many loans are there where franchise_name is NA? How many loans are there where the franchise_name is "Subway"? Answer below.
**Answer**:
192959 where the franchise_name is NA. 275 where the franchise_name is "Subway."

```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  group_by(franchise_name) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```
### Task 8: Examine the forgiveness_amount column for missing values.
**Task** Run the following codeblock to group by forgiveness_amount, count the numer of loans, then sort from highest to lowest on count. How many loans are there where forgiveness_amount is NA? Answer below.
**Answer**:
135073 where forgiveness amount is NA.

```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  group_by(forgiveness_amount) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

### Task 9: Examine the forgiveness_date column for missing values.
**Task** Run the following codeblock to group by forgiveness_date, count the numer of loans, then sort from highest to lowest on count and filter to only show NA values. How many loans are there where forgiveness_date is NA? Is it the same as the number for forgiveness_amount? Answer below.
**Answer**:
135073 loans where forgiveness_date is NA. It is the name as forgiveness_amount.

```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  group_by(forgiveness_date) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  filter(is.na(forgiveness_date)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```
### Task 10: Examine forgiveness_date and forgiveness_amount together
**Task** Run the following codeblock to group by forgiveness_date and forgiveness_amount, count the number of loans, then sort from highest to lowest on count and filter to only show NA values. How many loans are there where forgiveness_date and forgiveness_amount is NA? Is it the same as the number for forgiveness_amount and forgiveness_amount run separately in the codeblocks above? What can you conclude from Answer below.
**Answer**:
There are 135073 loans where forgiveness_date/amount are NA. It is the same number as before. I can conclude that this code is a faster way to get that comparison. Also I can conclude that these loans just were not forgiven if there is no amount or date.
```{r}
ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  group_by(forgiveness_amount, forgiveness_date) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  filter(is.na(forgiveness_date)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

```

**Task** Run the following codeblock to create a new column called "month_year_approved" that extracts the month and year from the "date_approved" column.  Group by the new "month_year_approved" column, count, and sort by "month_year_approved". How many loans are there in the data for October 2020? Answer below.
**Answer**
There are no loans in the data for October 2020.
```{r}
ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  mutate(month_year_approved = floor_date(date_approved, "month")) %>%
  group_by(month_year_approved) %>%
   summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(month_year_approved)
```

### Task 14: Check for suspicious outliers
**Task** Run the following codeblock to find the largest and smallest loans in the data, by using summarise() without grouping. How much is the largest loan for? How much is the smallest loan for? Are either of these suspicious to you? Why or why not? Answer below.
**Answer**
The largest loan is for 10000000 and the smallest loan is for 6. They both seem a little suspicious because I am not sure how often people get loans that big or that small.
```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  summarise(max_amount = max(amount),
            min_amount= min(amount))
```


### Task 15: Look at smallest loans
**Task** Run the following codeblock to examine all loans under $100. How many are there? Answer below.
**Answer**
There are two loans under $100.
```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
 filter(amount < 100)
```

### Task 16: Look for internal consistency
**Task** Run the following codeblock to examine all loans under $100 and look at whether the various fields with amounts align. Do they? Answer below.
**Answer**
All of the fields with amounts align in each of the rows.

```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
 filter(amount < 100) %>%
  select(name, amount, initial_approval_amount, current_approval_amount, payroll_proceed)
```

### Task 5: Examine the data table
**Task** Run the following codeblock to examine the data. Name three problems the book chapter says exist in this data set that could prevent us from answering questions?  Answer below
**Answer**
Three problems that could prevent us from answering questions: the column headers are not styled the same, there is a duplicated row, and the street addresses are not consistent.
```{r}
arnold_md_loans
```

### Task 6: Use clean_names()
**Task** Run the following codeblock to use the clean_names() function from janitor to standardize column names. How does the function change the name of the column "1_id"? Answer below.
**Answer**
It changes the name from 1_id to x1_id. 

```{r}
# cleaning function
cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names()

# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_arnold_md_loans
```

### Task 7: Use rename()
**Task** Run the following codeblock to use the clean_names() function from janitor to standardize column names and then use rename() to change the "x1_id" column.


```{r}
# cleaning function
cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = x1_id)

# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_arnold_md_loans


```

### Task 8: Try summarizing the amount column
**Task** Run the following codeblock to attempt to add up the amount of all loans. What does the error say when you run this code? What do you think it means? Answer below.
**Answer**
The error says "problem with summarise column and total amount" and "invalid type." I think it might mean that we are using the wrong type and it shouldn't be <chr>.
```{r}
# cleaning function
total_arnold_md_loans <- cleaned_arnold_md_loans %>%
  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount))

# display the cleaned dataset
total_arnold_md_loans


```
### Task 9: Change data type for amount
**Task** Run the following codeblock to attempt to change the datatype for the amount field to a number. What is the new data type (three letter code) for amount? Answer below.
**Answer**
The new data type is <dbl>.

```{r}
# cleaning function
cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = x1_id) %>%
  mutate(amount = as.numeric(amount))


# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_arnold_md_loans

```
### Task 10: Try again to summarize the amount column
**Task** Run the following codeblock to add up the amount of all loans in this data.  What is the total? Answer below.
**Answer**
2033179 is the total.
```{r}
# cleaning function
total_arnold_md_loans <- cleaned_arnold_md_loans %>%
  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount))

# display the cleaned dataset
total_arnold_md_loans


```

### Task 11: Check for duplicate rows
**Task** Run the following codeblock to check for duplicate rows using get_dupes().  How many are there? What is the business name? Answer below.
**Answer**
There are two rows. The business name is Stuart Jones LLC.

```{r}
cleaned_arnold_md_loans %>%
  get_dupes()
```

### Task 12: Check for duplicate rows
**Task** Run the following codeblock to use distinct() to get rid of duplicate rows. How many rows does the new dataframe have? Answer below.
**Answer**
There are five rows now.
```{r}
# cleaning function
cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = x1_id) %>%
  mutate(amount = as.numeric(amount)) %>%
  distinct()


# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_arnold_md_loans

```

### Task 13: Clean up ZIP code
**Task** Run the following codeblock to use str_sub() to convert the ZIP codes that have nine digits to five digits, standardizing the field.
**Answer**
There are five different spellings of Arnold.

```{r}

cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = x1_id) %>%
  mutate(amount = as.numeric(amount)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(zip = str_sub(zip, start=1L, end=5L)) %>%
  mutate(city = str_to_title(city))


# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_arnold_md_loans

```


### Task 15: Clean up city field more with case_when()
**Task** Run the following codeblock to use case_when() to fix misspellings of Arnold in the "city" field. How many mispellings of Arnold remain after running this code? Answer below.
**Answer**
Now there is only one misspelling of Arnold.

```{r}
# cleaning function
cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = x1_id) %>%

**Answer**
There are no more misspellings of Arnold.
```{r}
# cleaning function
cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = x1_id) %>%
  mutate(amount = as.numeric(amount)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(zip = str_sub(zip, start=1L, end=5L)) %>%
